This repository contains the I/O components and pretrained weights of a CNN model developed for predicting the relationship between the microstructure of lithium disilicate glass-ceramics and their Heat treatment condintions. 


The uploaded files include:

  1. state_dict.pth: Trained model weights (not stored in this repositroy due to the file size limit â€” see download instructions below)

  2. LS2CNN: Code for loading and using the model's I/O

  3. example_images/: Some sample microstructure images used to test the model
